# GOL-C
Conway's Game of Life implemented in C. 

Mainly for teaching myself C.

Planning to turn this into an installable Terminal application.

## To install:
```console
$ make
```

## To run:

```console
$ ./GOL.c -e {number of evolutions} -s {random seed} -t {number of seconds between evolutions}
```
